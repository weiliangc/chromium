# Rebaselined because of different clipping behavior, sometimes more accurate
# (e.g. about css clip), sometimes less accurate (e.g. when clip has transforms)

# Rebaselined: We use FrameView::x() and FrameView::y() which are integers to
# generate FrameViewpreTranslation, but the old path uses offsets in the layout tree.

# Rebaselined because we expand local paint invalidation rect to whole pixels
# before mapping it to backing so it may cover extra pixels causing incremental
# invalidation not applicable.

# Rebaselined paint/invalidation/svg because we do more accurate pixel snapping

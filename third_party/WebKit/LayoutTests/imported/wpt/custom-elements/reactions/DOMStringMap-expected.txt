This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS setter on DOMStringMap must enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when adding an observed data attribute 
PASS setter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when adding an unobserved data attribute 
PASS setter on DOMStringMap must enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when mutating the value of an observed data attribute 
FAIL setter on DOMStringMap must enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when mutating the value of an observed data attribute to the same value assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected 1 got 0
PASS setter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when mutating the value of an unobserved data attribute 
PASS deleter on DOMStringMap must enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when removing an observed data attribute 
PASS deleter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when removing an unobserved data attribute 
PASS deleter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when it does not remove a data attribute 
Harness: the test ran to completion.

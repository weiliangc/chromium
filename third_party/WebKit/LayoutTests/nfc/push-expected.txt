This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test that passing undefined to nfc.push would raise TypeMismatchError. 
PASS Test that promise is rejected with SyntaxError if NFCMessage is invalid. 
PASS nfc.push should fail when NFC HW is disabled. 
PASS nfc.push should fail when NFC HW is not supported. 
PASS nfc.push should succeed when NFC HW is enabled 
PASS nfc.push should fail with TimeoutError when push operation is not completed before specified timeout value. 
PASS nfc.push NFCMessage containing text, json, opaque and url records with default NFCPushOptions. 
PASS nfc.push String with default NFCPushOptions. 
PASS nfc.push ArrayBuffer with default NFCPushOptions. 
PASS Check that default NFCPushOptions values are correctly set. 
PASS Check that provided NFCPushOptions values are correctly converted. 
PASS Push ArrayBuffer with default NFCPushOptions. 
PASS nfc.cancelPush should succeed if there is pending push operation. 
PASS nfc.push should fail with TimeoutError when push operation is not completed before specified timeout value. 
PASS nfc.cancelPush should reject pending promise with AbortError.
